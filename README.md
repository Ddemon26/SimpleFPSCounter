# FPSCounter

The `FPSCounter` script is a Unity component that measures and displays the frames per second (FPS) in a Unity scene. It is designed to be attached to an empty GameObject in the initial scene.

## Features

- **Real-time FPS Display:** Continuously updates and displays the FPS in the scene.
- **Screen Size Adaptation:** Automatically adjusts the display size and font based on screen dimensions.
- **Scene Persistence:** Persists across scene changes to provide consistent FPS tracking.

## Usage

1. Create an empty GameObject in your initial Unity scene.
2. Attach the `FPSCounter` script to the GameObject.
3. Run the scene to see the FPS counter displayed on the screen.

## Customization

You can modify the script to change the display style, update interval, or other parameters to suit your needs.
